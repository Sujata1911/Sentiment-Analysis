This is my notes on Open Refine tutorial by Colin Skow.

Terms to be used:
FACETING
Breaking data into smaller buckets so that they are easy to work with. Here, we  have used text facets and numeric facets.
ATOMIZATION
Splitting multivalued cells into separate cells
CLUSTERING
A technique which groups similar data

To get started:
Start with ./refine in the terminal, choose your file (I have used .tsv file for the purpose), next and create a new project.

STEPS TO CLEAN YOUR DATA 
STEP 1:
RecordID --> facet --> numeric facet
Output: no numeric value present
TO remove that error:
RecordID --> Edit Cells --> Common transforms --> Numbers

STEP 2:
Check the number of empty rows. Removing them:
All --> Edit rows --> Remove all matching rows
(close the dialogue box on the extreme left)
(after every step, close the dialogue box on the left)

STEP 3:
Remove Duplicates
RecordID --> Sort --> numbers, smallest first --> OK
Sort(appears on top) --> Reorder rows permanently (Dont skip this step, it will mess up your steps later)

STEP 4:
Blank Down : 1st instance of duplicate is intact, remaining ones become blanck cells
to do it:
RecordID --> Edit Cells --> Blank Down

STEP 5:
Remove all rows where RecordID is blank
RecordID --> facet --> customize facet --> facet by blank --> true (to select rows where RecordID is blank)
All --> edit Rows --> remove all matching rows

STEP 6:
Fixing the category
Category --> Edit cells --> Split multivalued cells --> change separator to '|' because this is what has been used --> OK
(this step is called atomization)
we have gone from 43k approx to 93 approx

Category --> facet --> text facet
You get warning
Up the limit and set it to 5000 --> OK

We can now see the categories

STEP 7:
(blank) means no category was specified
Cluster --> method:key collision; keying function:ngram-fingerprint; ngram size:4
(in this case, selesct all except the 1st one because its not the matching data)

STEP 8: 
Categories --> Edit cells --> join multivalued cells --> OK

STEP 9:
Categories --> edit cells --> transform 
value.split('|').uniques().join('|')
{split the values by '|' character, selesct only the unique values and rejoin them using '|' character in a list}
--> OK

STEP 10:
export --> tab separated value
It downloads your clean file and viola!!! you are done :)
